                        Hey there! I am Anya Kathpalia, a first year Computer Science major at Tech. 
                        <p>
                            I am the founder of <a href = "https://www.hersuccessbits.com">hersuccessbits.com</a>, a women empowerment platform which brings the voices of diverse women into limelight.
                            hersuccessbits.com has been reccognised by the United Nations and the National e Governance Division, Government Of India. 
                            Her Success Bits is a 1000+ member community and has interviews and stories of over 100 women from across the globe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During COVID times, I undertook a massive social project <i> Project Jagriti </i> through which I raised funds 
                            and gave digital literacy sessions and smart phones to over 200 women artisans from a network of villages in rural 
                            Rajasthan. <i>Project Jagriti</i> was featured in numerous local newspapers of Rajasthan. I was also shortlisted as one of the 10 finalists worldwide for the Canon Young Champion of the Year award by Global Good Awards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I strongly believe in <i> Imaging For Good </i> and creatively using the digital spaces for social impact. My <a href = "https://twitter.com/canonukandie/status/1440601995824427008?s=24">video</a> on <i>Project Jagriti</i>  was shortlisted by the UN and Canon and featured as part of the UN 2021 week to Act4SDGs.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am also currently developing a productity app using React Native and firebase (<a href = "https://github.com/anyakath/my-success-bits_react-native">github repository</a>) and am really passionate about frontend dev. I really do look forward to being a part of the Bits of Good Team and continue making a positive impact in our community.
